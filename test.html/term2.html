<h1>What I did 

    Firstly, I installed windows 10 on a new virtual machine and configure a windows server. 
    
    I configured the network connection to bridge mode so that devices could see each other.  Then I made a windows server and configured an active directory. When I was installing the windows server, I had to select both active directory domain services and a DNSserver. I then had to create an admin password, which if forgotten you would have to redo the whole installation process again. I created a user which was only allowed to do certain things and wasn't allowed to run as administrator.  
    
    I had to enter the original administrator password for the user because they did not have permission. After this I granted the user permission so they could access it independently. I manged to do this semi-independantly with a small amount of guidance.  </h1>
